# Dianetic_retinopathy_prediction
# Project Overview
Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, leading to vision loss if untreated. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify retinal fundus images and detect the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy.
# Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available datasets, such as:
1. APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection (Kaggle)

The dataset contains fundus images categorized into five severity levels:
1. No DR (0) - No diabetic retinopathy detected
2. Mild DR (1) - Early-stage symptoms
3. Moderate DR (2) - More noticeable damage
4. Severe DR (3) - High risk of vision loss
5. Proliferative DR (4) - Advanced stage requiring immediate treatment
